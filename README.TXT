TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system.

This project is discussed in chapter 6.


This project implements a technical support system for customers of the 
DodgySoft software company. Users can describe their software problems and 
get advice instantly!

The idea is based on Eliza - a famous program described by Joseph Weizenbaum 
in 1966. (Do a web search for "Eliza" and "Weizenbaum" if you want to know 
more about this.)

In fact, it is much more primitive than Eliza. But that's enough to match the 
quality of many software companies' technical support advice...  ;-)

To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and study library classes, such 
as ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and Random.

24. A HashMap stores pairs of values. You can put and get values in it with put and get
26. The size() function
28. Updates value
29. Duplicates get overwritten
30. public boolean searchName(String name)
    {
        boolean found = contacts.containsKey(name);
        return found;
    }
31. It returns false
32. The values() method
33, 37, 38. Didn't read these questions when I opened this version of the project.
    The questions are already answered.
34. Their implementations are not synchronized and they have iterators
35. You don't need to remember an index number
36. I don't know, but it's a string so I don't think so
